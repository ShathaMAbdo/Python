l = [45, 75, 69, 12, 48, 1, 24, 71]
a = [‘sdf’, ‘abc’, ‘qwe’]
b = [“Python”, “Java”, 200, 32.787]
Tuple is a group of comma-separated values within parenthesis and parenthesis is optional.
tuple1 = (32. 67, 15, 89, 94, 74, 1, 24, 17)

# 7.What are operators? 
Operators are special symbols, combinations of symbols, or keywords that designate some type of computation. You can combine objects and operators to build expressions that perform the actual computation. So, operators are the building blocks of expressions, which you can use to manipulate our data.
