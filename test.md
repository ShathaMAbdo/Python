# â€¢ Summarize the initial incident:

In the company's central building in the server room, one of the employees cut off the power to the cooling unit in the hall, which led to the server being affected and important data being lost. Customers noticed this outage immediately after it occurred at two o'clock in the afternoon, and some of them contacted the support department, which reported it.
In a preliminary examination of the servers, it was verified that they were not damaged, but only stopped, and when they were restarted, it was found that they were operating as usual. However, upon retrieving the backup copy, it was confirmed that some data had been lost and the customer must be contacted to complete it.
